## Quick start
Our project is a deep learning based image segmentation solution to first detect the brain tumor and then predict the likelihood of tumor existence.
### Problem definition
The lack of advanced technology in Africa is noticed in many fields (agriculture, finance etc.). In Healthcare, the analysis of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is still done by human intervention.  This sometimes leads to misinterpretations when the cancer is at early stage. We are interested here in the case of brain tumor. 
Brain Cancer detection is an urgent problem since its death rate is comparable the combined deaths from HIV, tuberculosis and malaria in West Africa.
The MRI scan takes between 30-45 mn in average. But the process of analyzing images can take up to 3 days to get the results when it is a cancer case.
In order to make a reliable and rapid analysis, our prototype is designed to quickly detect brain tumors. Our approach is Computer vision based which has shown enormous performance in fields such as Self-Driving cars.


- To begin, clone the repo: 
``` 
git clone link_to_the_repo && cd folder_name 

``` 



## Prerequisites

Ensure you have met the following requirements by installing the following packages:

<!--- These are just example requirements. Add, duplicate or remove as required --->
  
* pandas==1.0.5
* numpy==1.18.5
* albumentations==0.5.2
* opencv_python_headless==4.4.0.46
* matplotlib==3.2.2
* torchvision==0.7.0
* torch==1.6.0
* scikit_learn==0.23.2

It can be done through this command line: ```pip install -r requirements```
## Dataset

The data can be found in this link: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation
">Brain MRI segmentation</a>. It can be loaded following these steps:

- Generate a key in you kaggle account.
- run these commands:

``` 
!mkdir ~/.kaggle/
!echo '{"username":"your_user_name","key":"key_you_have_generated"}' > ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
!kaggle datasets download -d mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation

```
## How to Train & Test
This <a href="https://github.com/mofadel/brain_tumor_detection/blob/main/Brain-mri_RESTNET_UNET_MODEL.ipynb
">jupyter notebook</a> contains a simple tutorial on how to load the data, train and test the model.
Another alternative to train and test a model is to run the following script.
```
!python main.py
```
##### Please change $DATA_PATH variable at the very beginning of the notebook (if you are using it) to the path containing the Brain Tumor detection data.
##### If you are running the script the $DATA_PATH variable can be located in the main.py file.


Add run commands and examples you think users will find useful. Provide
an options reference for bonus points!
